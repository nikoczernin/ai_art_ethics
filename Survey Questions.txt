Chosen topic: Ethical concerns regarding artists' compensation for contributing to AI-generated art

Survey questions:
	1.	Take a piece of art or text, generated entirely by a generative model (for an example of AI generated images, see Midjourney: https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/). The model in question was trained using a single artist’s or author's work. The resulting output completely matches his style, creating a fake that would fool anyone. In your opinion, to how much of this piece’s generated revenue is the original artist/author entitled to? 
	•	Answer: numerical ranging from 0% to 100% (of the generated revenue)
	2.	Are you an artist/author yourself or have you created art/copywriting before (paid or unpaid, but mostly passionately)?
	•	No, I have not created any art or copywriting passionately before.
	•	I have created some art or copywriting before, but I do not care much for art.
	•	I have a passion for art/copywriting, even though I do not create a lot.
	•	I have a passion for art/copywriting and I like to create a lot in my free-time.
	3.	Would you boycott a piece of art/copywriting, if the artist/author were used as training data and did not get compensated for it at all?
	•	Yes
	•	No
	•	Only if I really like the artist
